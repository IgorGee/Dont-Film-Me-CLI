# Don't Film Me!

Many people are sensitive to their faces being shown publicly on video without
their consent. Cinematographers often need to have subjects within the video
to sign a release form of some sort, which can be a hassle at times, and
perhaps unnecessary for the purposes of their video. A good solution to avoiding
this hassle is to simply blur the subjectâ€™s face from the post-production
footage. However, this is often a tedious task that usually requires manual
work. Automating this task will make the life of video editors much simpler,
and save them a significant amount of time.

The goal of **Don't Film Me** is to provide a tool to assist with this task of
blurring by automating the process.

## How it works

1. Get a `reference` face
2. Break the video down into images and audio
3. Compare one image against the `reference` face every `f` images
  - `f`: frequency of frame analysis
  - Analysis is done via [Microsoft Cognitive Services Vision API](Microsoft Cognitive Services Vision API)

4. Blur the face region of the image for `f` frames if there is a match
  - A neat optimization would be blur the previous 5 or 10 frames as well as
    the following 5-10 frames. This usually ensures full coverage throughout the
    video.
  - The blurring is done via the [StackBlur Algorithm](https://github.com/flozz/StackBlur), which is an amazing
    blurring algorithm. It's similar to Gaussian, but is 7x faster, making it
    a very viable option to use as a real-time tool.
5. Stitch the images and audio back together. Et voila!

## Usage

`babel-node blur.js <video_file> <reference_image>`
